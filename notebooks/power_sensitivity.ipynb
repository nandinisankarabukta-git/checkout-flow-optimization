        "- Power increases with both sample size and effect size\n",
        "- Diminishing returns: doubling sample size doesn't double power\n",
        "- Small effect sizes (< 1.5pp) require prohibitively large samples\n",

        "- Minimum viable sample for 2% uplift at 80% power: _TBD_\n",
        "- Trade-off analysis: runtime vs. confidence in results\n",
        "- If power is insufficient, consider: longer runtime, larger MDE, or sequential testing\n",
        "\n",
        "**A/A Validation:**\n",
        "- False positive rate should be ≈5% (matching α)\n",
        "- If systematically higher: investigate SRM (Sample Ratio Mismatch) or instrumentation issues\n",
        "- If systematically lower: tests may be too conservative\n",

        "**Practical Recommendations:**\n",
        "- Recommended minimum sample size for standard 2pp MDE: _TBD_\n",
        "- When to use larger samples (small expected effects, high business impact)\n",
        "- When to use smaller samples (rapid iteration, low cost of false negatives)\n",

        "2. Adjust MDE expectations if current sample size provides insufficient power\n",
        "3. Plan experiment duration to accumulate required samples\n",
