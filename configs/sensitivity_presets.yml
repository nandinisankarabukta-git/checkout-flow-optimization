# Sensitivity Analysis Presets
# =============================
# Predefined parameter configurations for power/sensitivity analysis runs
# Usage: Reference these presets when running src/analysis/sensitivity.py

presets:
  # Quick smoke test for validating the pipeline
  quick_smoke:
    description: "Minimal grid for fast validation and smoke testing"
    days: 1
    users_per_day: [20000]
    uplifts: [0.0, 0.02]
    repeats: 5
    seed: 7
    expected_runtime: "~2 minutes"
    use_case: "CI/CD checks, quick pipeline validation"

  # Full demonstration with comprehensive parameter sweep
  full_demo:
    description: "Comprehensive grid for power analysis and experiment planning"
    days: 1
    users_per_day: [20000, 50000, 100000]
    uplifts: [0.0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03]
    repeats: 20
    seed: 7
    expected_runtime: "~10-15 minutes"
    use_case: "Detailed power curves, sample size recommendations"

# Notes:
# - uplifts: 0.0 validates false positive rate (A/A test), others measure statistical power
# - repeats: Higher values give more stable power estimates (recommended: â‰¥20 for production)
# - users_per_day: Test range should bracket your expected daily traffic
# - seed: Keep consistent for reproducibility across runs
