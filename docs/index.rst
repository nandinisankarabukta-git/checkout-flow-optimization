Checkout Flow Optimization
==========================

Welcome to my A/B testing framework for checkout flow optimization! I built this project to solve a common challenge in e-commerce, how do you know if your checkout improvements actually work?

This framework provides everything you need to run rigorous A/B tests on checkout flows, from data generation to statistical analysis to executive reporting. It's designed to be both powerful and easy to use.

What You'll Find Here
---------------------

* **Getting Started** - Everything you need to set up and run your first experiment
* **Commands Reference** - All the commands I've built to make your life easier
* **Source Code Documentation** - Detailed docs for the Python modules (coming soon)

Quick Overview
--------------

I've put a lot of thought into making this framework different from typical A/B testing tools. Here's what makes it special:

* **Statistically Rigorous** - Proper hypothesis testing with confidence intervals
* **Production-Ready** - Built with real-world constraints in mind
* **Easy to Use** - One command runs the entire pipeline
* **Transparent** - You can see exactly how the analysis works

The framework generates synthetic checkout data, runs statistical tests, and produces clear ship/no-ship recommendations. Perfect for data scientists, product managers, and anyone who needs to make data-driven decisions about checkout improvements.
